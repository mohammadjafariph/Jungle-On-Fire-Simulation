# Jungle-On-Fire-Simulation
I simulate a jungle on fire model. We have 4 state in system : 
1 - Empty (No tree in that position)
2- Green tree (green)
3- Tree on fire (orange)
4- Burned out tree (black)
Fire starts with one tree in system. then we search for each tree in four main directions (up,down,left,right) for fire . if we found fire in any of these directions we set tree on fire.
